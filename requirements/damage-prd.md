Player Health and Damage Rules
1. Health System
Starting Health: Each player begins with 100 Health Points (HP), represented as a 100% health bar visible above their car.

Purpose: This gives players a clear, manageable amount of durability to survive collisions and attacks.

2. Collision Damage
Car-to-Car Collisions:
Damage Calculation: When two cars collide, the damage each car takes is based on their relative speed. Damage = (relative speed) / 5, with a minimum of 5 HP.
Example: If two cars hit head-on, each going 50 mph, relative speed = 100 mph, so each loses 20 HP.

Example: If one car at 50 mph hits a stationary car, relative speed = 50 mph, so each loses 10 HP.

Invincibility Period: After a collision, both cars gain a 0.5-second invincibility period where they cannot take or deal further collision damage. This prevents excessive damage from repeated impacts in quick succession.

Car-to-Wall/Obstacle Collisions:
Damage Calculation: Damage = (car’s speed) / 10, with a minimum of 5 HP.
Example: Hitting a wall at 50 mph deals 5 HP damage; at 100 mph, it deals 10 HP.

Purpose: Encourages careful driving while maintaining the fast-paced, aggressive feel of the game.

3. Power-Ups
Health Icons:
Effect: Collecting a health icon fully restores the car’s health to 100 HP.

Spawning: 2-3 health icons appear at random locations on the map and respawn at new random spots 30 seconds after being collected.

Purpose: Provides players a way to recover, encouraging exploration and strategic movement.

Shield Icons:
Effect: Collecting a shield icon grants invincibility (no damage taken) for 1 minute.

Spawning: 2-3 shield icons spawn randomly on the map and respawn 30 seconds after being collected.

Purpose: Offers temporary protection, adding a tactical layer to gameplay (duration can be adjusted later if too strong).

4. Elimination and Respawn
Elimination: When a car’s HP reaches 0%, it is destroyed, and a "wasted" screen appears with a respawn button.

Respawn: Upon clicking the button, the player respawns with 100 HP at a random location on the map.

Purpose: Keeps players in the game, maintaining the chaotic, continuous action of Need for Madness.
5. Levelsio Bot (AI Opponent)
Health: The bot has 2000 HP (20 times a player’s health), making it a tough adversary.

Damage Dealt:
Collisions: Follows the same rules as player-to-player collisions (damage = (relative speed) / 5, minimum 5 HP).

Machine Gun: Fires bullets at 2 shots per second, with each bullet dealing 5 HP damage to players.

Damage Taken: Players can damage the bot through collisions, calculated the same way as player-to-player collisions.

Elimination: When the bot’s HP reaches 0, the player who dealt the final blow earns 100 kill points. The bot respawns after 1 minute at a random location.

Purpose: Adds a challenging, roaming threat inspired by Need for Madness’s aggressive AI cars.

6. Kill Points
Player Eliminations: When a player eliminates another player via collision, they earn 1 kill point. The point goes to the player whose collision reduced the opponent’s HP to 0.

Bot Elimination: Eliminating the bot awards 100 kill points.

Exceptions: No kill points are awarded for eliminations caused by wall collisions or bot attacks (only player-to-player or player-to-bot eliminations count).

Purpose: Encourages aggressive play and rewards skillful eliminations, mirroring the competitive chaos of Need for Madness.
